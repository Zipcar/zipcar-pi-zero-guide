===========================================

Welcome!
--------
You're here because you know that the best things in life are worth tinkering with, reimagining, and doing yourself. We think so, too.

That's why we've teamed up with Raspberry Pi to bring 314 new perspectives (like yours) to a growing community of digital makers. We want you to explore what drives you to createâ€”but that doesn't mean you have to go it alone. So we put together some of our favorite Pi projects to help you get started (along with some extra ingredients we thought you might like) and outlined them all here. Let's get started.


Inside your kit
---------------
We want to make sure you hit the ground running with your Pi projects, so we've included the following in your kit:


- 1x Raspberry Pi Zero W
- 1x microSD card (4 GB)
- 1x microSD to SD card adapter
- 1x micro USB cable
- 1x micro USB to USB adapter
- 1x micro USB AC power plug
- 1x mini HDMI to HDMI adapter


Additional Ingredients (Not Included)
-------------------------------------
If you're feeling adventurous once you get started, you might want:

- USB Hub
- HDMI display or Raspberry Pi Screen
- soldering iron and solder
- wire (we recommend 16 gauge, but you can go down to 18 or 24 for different applications)
- wire stripper
- board pins (2x20)


Safety First!
-------------
- If you solder, do so in a well ventilated space
- Wear safety glasses when soldering or using power tools
