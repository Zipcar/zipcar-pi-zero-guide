>Electronics projects intimidated me for a long time. What do I know about circuits and switches? Where would I even begin if I wanted to build a bus-stop alert system? What if I ruin something critical because I don't know how to solder correctly? Doubt can be a debilitating force, so I sat by admiring all the cool projects others were posting to the Internet: robots, smart costumes, home automation systems; there were so many great ideas coming out of the DiY (Do-it-Yourself) community. I finally saw one project that struck a chord - a custom arcade cabinet powered by something called a Raspberry Pi. This tiny little computer was capable of so much, and for a remarkably low price. When the even-cheaper, adorably-small [Raspberry Pi Zero][pi-zero-specs] was released, I knew my excuses for giving in to my doubt were over. My goal was clear - use the Pi Zero to build the ultimate gaming console for road-trips! No soldering required, and everything I needed was lying around the house - an hour of reading and setup later, and I was playing some of my favorite video games straight out of the 80s.

>For my next Pi project, I've begun to assemble a _portable_ console, powered by the Pi Zero, complete with a screen, buttons, rechargeable battery, and speakers. I no longer fear soldering, and have plenty of backup Pi Zeroes if I make a mistake. It's a significantly more difficult project, and I'm a little out of my depth, but the Pi community has tons of guides, tips, and forums to help me along.

>That's the great thing about the Pi community; its enthusiasm, diversity, and unending ideas drive you forward, instead of leaving you stalled. Whether you want to build a media center for your living room, or a robot to cook and serve you waffles in the morning, you aren't alone in the journey - the community is there to share and celebrate failures alongside successes, as we all learn together.
